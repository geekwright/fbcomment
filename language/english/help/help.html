<h3>Quick Start Guide to FBComments</h3>

<h4 class="odd">Overview</h4>

<p class="even"><b>FBComments</b> provides blocks which add Facebook&reg; Like Button, Comments and Activity Feed functionality to your site. 
Page specific comments can be added quickly without requiring any changes to module templates. Open Graph meta tags are automatically added 
to pages where the blocks are used, and additional page specific data can be easily specified using the built in Open Graph Meta Data editor.

<h4 class="odd">First Steps</h4>

<p class="even">Although not strictly necessary, you may want to register <i>yourself as a developer</i> (and <i>optionally, your site as an application</i>) on <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/</a>.

<p class="even">Familiarize yourself with the Facebook concepts and Social Plugins you are going to use. These resources may be helpful:

<li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/"  target="_blank">Comments</a>
<li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/activity/"  target="_blank">Activity Feed</a>

<li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/"  target="_blank">Feed Dialog</a>
</ul>

<h4 class="odd">Configuration</h4>
<p class="even">Enter <b>either</b> (not both) your numeric facebook user id (<a href="http://findmyfacebookid.com/" target="_blank">Here 
is a tool to help find that.</a>) as an admin or your assigned application id in the module preferences. If you don't, things 
will still function, but the Facebook debugger will complain, and you will not be able to moderate comments left on your pages. 
You can specify multiple admins by entering multiple numeric facebook user ids separated by commas, but be aware that this will 
only work correctly if you enable the smarty open graph meta data option as described below.
<p class="even">To use the Show Feed block, you must enter both an applid and the secret for the appid in the module preferences. 
This is a requirement of the Facebook SDK for PHP which is used to implement this block.

<p class="even">For the best results, add the following Smarty tag to the <i>&lt;head&gt;</i> section of your theme's theme.html:
<pre style="font-family: courier,mono;">
      &lt;{$fbcomment_og_metas}&gt;
</pre>

<p class="even">Then choose 'Yes' for the Enable Smarty Open Graph Meta data option in FBComments module preferences. This will give 
you the best meta tags possible for communicating with Facebook. (Note: The theme change is <b>required</b> if you choose 'Yes' 
for this option.) With this option set to 'No' Facebook will still find most of the information it wants, but it will issue 
warnings when checking your pages, and some administrative tools will not be available.

<p class="even">You might also want to specify a default <em>og:image</em> to be used if no image is supplied by the Open Graph Editor or 
through a plugin. This image should be specified as a fully qualified URL, and should be at least 200x200 pixels. Keep in mind
that Facebook will resize this image to fit its layout, so a little extra size makes for a better presentation. 
If no image is specified, Facebook will attempt to grab an image from your page and use that. While it makes a decent attempt, the 
results can be disappointing. Supplying a default here gives you control over how your pages will be presented.

<p class="even">Enable the blocks of your choice on your site to suit your needs.

<p class="even">Check your site with the Facebook Debugger at <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug" 
target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug</a> to check for problems.

<h4 class="odd">Block Options</h4>

<p class="even">Most of the options are explained in the Facebook social plugin documentation mentioned above, and control how the plugin is 
displayed on your site.

<p class="even">The option requiring the most attention is the "Source of URL sent to Facebook." Each page where a 
like, comment or post to feed block is displayed needs to supply 
a URL (the <em>og:url</em> property) to Facebook to identify what is being 'Liked' or 'Commented'. You can specify a specific URL (so, 
for example, a like button will like the whole site) or use the Automatic URL and Variables options to build canonical URLs for the pages 
(so that each page gets its own comments, for example.)

<p class="even">Consider a news module that can highlight the key words used in a search. A visitor might search the site, and end up viewing 
an article with a URL like "http://example.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=256&keywords=skateboard". Now imagine the visitor
adds a comment. If the comment referenced the whole URL, nobody would find the comment on your site without searching for "skateboard"
and this is probably not what you want. Maybe even worse, the visitor could be oblivious to all of the comments left by other visitors,
since they didn't all search for "skateboard" either.

<p class="even">To solve this problem we need to eliminate the junk from the URL we use to hang our comments on, or in a more concise wording, make 
it a canonical URL. FBComments implements this filtering with a whitelist of variables to include. By adding "storyid" into this list 
(and making sure "keywords" is not in the list) the above referenced URL would become 
"http://example.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=256". Now, no matter what else is going on, all comments for the story will be 
grouped together, and everyone visiting the page will see them no matter how they got there. Also, if your site can be accessed by both 
http and https protocols you may also want to use the <em>Automatic Force to http://</em> option so that all comments will be under 
a single URL (so "https://example.com/" becomes "http://example.com/".)

<p class="even">You can also require that something from the variable whitelist be found in the URL before the comments are enabled. This feature can
be used to allow comments on articles while keepings them off of the index page and other such places where they might not be appropriate.

<h4 class="odd">Open Graph Protocol Meta Data Editor</h4>
<p class="even">If you have admin rights to the FBComments module, FBComments blocks will display an clickable icon to bring up the 
meta data editor for the <em>og:url</em> that is presented by the page. In this editor you can upload an image to be associated with 
your page, and supply a title and description, giving you a chance to supply a customized view of your individual page when it is 
shared on Facebook. 
<p class="even">On initial entry, the editor will show the current data which will be supplied to Facebook. This data can come from
FBComments module configuration (default image,) a module plugin, or be set by a previous invocation of the meta data editor. 
If supported by your browser, changes are registered as made, and you can drag and drop an image file onto the editor to change it.
Clicking on the checkmark icon beside the URL (near the bottom of the editor display) will invoke the Facebook debugger for the 
current <em>og:url</em> context, so you can check for any issues.

<h4 class="odd">Important Note</h4>
<p class="even">If you use more than one block on a page, keep in mind that there can only be ONE set of Open Graph data associated 
with a given page. If the blocks specify different URLs, only one of them will be used. 
(The blocks which have "no" in the Sets OG Data column above are exceptions to this rule, as they do not establish any open graph data for the page.)

<h4 class="odd">Module Permissions</h4>
<p class="even">This module does not have a real main page at this time. It consists only of blocks and the necessary scripts to support 
those blocks. Attempts to use the fbcomment/index.php will result in a fully functional empty page. It is recommended to turn it off
in the main menu in the CMS module administration area.

<p class="even">Group access permissions to the FBComments module are required to use the blocks, above and beyond the block display permission. 
Interacting with the blocks records the URL, action and datetime, and also triggers XOOPS style notification via AJAX style calls to scripts in 
the fbcomment directory which use the standard mainfile inclusion which adds a layer of additional protections (such as protector) but requires access permissions to work as intended. 

<p class="even">Also note, in normal operation, Facebook will pull data from your site as the <b>anonymous</b> user. 
If blocks are not visible, the meta data Facebook expects will not be exposed, and the results will be less than optimal.

<p class="even">Module administration permissions enable in-block editing of Open Graph meta data.

<h4 class="odd">Caching</h4>
<p class="even">In general, fbcomments blocks should not be cached. These blocks set page meta data outside the confines of the blocks 
themselves and they can change their content based on the page context in which they are displayed. Further, the majority of the 
block content comes not from block, but from the Facebook content loaded through javascript.
<p class="even">The <strong>exception</strong> to this rule is the "Show Feed" block. This block is generated entirely within the CMS 
itself by making calls to the Facebook API. This can be a resource intensive operation, and caching will provide significant performance 
enhancement. Choose the highest cache time that is reasonable for your feed's typical activity level.

<h4 class="odd">Plugins</h4>
<p class="even">It is possible to extend the default Open Graph data for a module through the use of plugins. Plugins can supply 
page appropriate images, titles, better descriptions, canonical URLs, and more. The plugin mechanism is documented in the docs 
folder of the FBComments module distribution.

<h4 class="odd">Notifications and Logging</h4>
<p class="even">As mentioned under permissions, each like and comment action is captured. Module administrators may subscribe
standard XOOPS style notifications of new actions. A summary of the most recent activity is available in the module administration 
area. Likes and comments are recorded in separate tables. The captured data is in aggregate, and no identifying user data is 
recorded by this module (but what Facebook does with the data is anyone's guess.) The data consists of the URL, the first time the 
action occurred for URL, the most recent time the action for the URL occurred, and the total number of times the action has occurred. 
This data is captured, but beyond the simple recent displays, it is not otherwise processed in the module at this time. (But it would
be a great use for gwreports to study it the way you want to see it.)

<h4 class="odd">In Use: Third Party Cookies</h4>
<p class="even">Facebook social plugins are notoriously sensitive to the user's browser third party cookie settings. If third party 
cookies are not enabled, the comment and like imagery may appear correctly, but they may fail in various ways when used. 
FBComments blocks loads javascript from connect.facebook.net which inserts an iframe in the page sourced from facebook.com with 
multiple chunks of stuff cached through Akamai, that ultimately ends up with the users facebook login status showing.
While it might seem at first that it would be nice, if this really worked without third party cookie permissions, it should be 
considered a browser security bug.
